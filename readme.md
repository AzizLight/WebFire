WebFire
=======

WebFire is a stand-alone web version of
[fire](https://github.com/AzizLight/fire).

Installation
------------

### Using fire

This method is still under development and will be available soon. Also,
it will become the recommended method to install WebFire.

### Manually

Copy the contents of the folders to right location. So the `fire` folder
in the controllers folder should go in the controllers folder of your
application. The assets folder should be copied as-is in the root of
your application (where the index.php file is). The directory structure
of your application should look similar to this after installing
WebFire:

Usage
-----

Navigate to the `fire/generate` controller, ie:
`http://example.com/index.php/fire/generate` and navigate through the
links to create controllers, models or migrations.
